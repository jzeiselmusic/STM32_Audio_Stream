<h1 class="settitle">Prerequisites for GCC</h1>
<a name="index-Prerequisites-1"></a>
GCC requires that various tools and packages be available for use in the
build procedure.  Modifying GCC sources requires additional tools
described below.

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC0"></a>Tools/packages necessary for building GCC</h3>

     <dl>
<dt>ISO C++11 compiler<dd>Necessary to bootstrap GCC.  GCC 4.8.3 or newer has sufficient
support for used C++11 features, with earlier GCC versions you
might run into implementation bugs.

     <p>Versions of GCC prior to 11 also allow bootstrapping with an ISO C++98
compiler, versions of GCC prior to 4.8 also allow bootstrapping with a
ISO C89 compiler, and versions of GCC prior to 3.4 also allow
bootstrapping with a traditional (K&amp;R) C compiler.

     <p>To build all languages in a cross-compiler or other configuration where
3-stage bootstrap is not performed, you need to start with an existing
GCC binary (version 4.8.3 or later) because source code for language
frontends other than C might use GCC extensions.

     <br><dt>C standard library and headers<dd>
In order to build GCC, the C standard library and headers must be present
for all target variants for which target libraries will be built (and not
only the variant of the host C++ compiler).

     <p>This affects the popular `<samp><span class="samp">x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</span></samp>' platform (among
other multilib targets), for which 64-bit (`<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>') and 32-bit
(`<samp><span class="samp">i386</span></samp>') libc headers are usually packaged separately. If you do a
build of a native compiler on `<samp><span class="samp">x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</span></samp>', make sure you
either have the 32-bit libc developer package properly installed (the exact
name of the package depends on your distro) or you must build GCC as a
64-bit only compiler by configuring with the option
<samp><span class="option">--disable-multilib</span></samp>.  Otherwise, you may encounter an error such as
`<samp><span class="samp">fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file</span></samp>'

     <br><dt><a name="GNAT-prerequisite"></a>GNAT<dd>
In order to build GNAT, the Ada compiler, you need a working GNAT
compiler (GCC version 5.1 or later).

     <p>This includes GNAT tools such as <samp><span class="command">gnatmake</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">gnatlink</span></samp>, since the Ada front end is written in Ada and
uses some GNAT-specific extensions.

     <p>In order to build a cross compiler, it is strongly recommended to install
the new compiler as native first, and then use it to build the cross
compiler. Other native compiler versions may work but this is not guaranteed and
will typically fail with hard to understand compilation errors during the
build.

     <p>Similarly, it is strongly recommended to use an older version of GNAT to build
GNAT. More recent versions of GNAT than the version built are not guaranteed
to work and will often fail during the build with compilation errors.

     <p>Note that <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> does not test whether the GNAT installation works
and has a sufficiently recent version; if too old a GNAT version is
installed and <samp><span class="option">--enable-languages=ada</span></samp> is used, the build will fail.

     <p><samp><span class="env">ADA_INCLUDE_PATH</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">ADA_OBJECT_PATH</span></samp> environment variables
must not be set when building the Ada compiler, the Ada tools, or the
Ada runtime libraries. You can check that your build environment is clean
by verifying that `<samp><span class="samp">gnatls -v</span></samp>' lists only one explicit path in each
section.

     <br><dt><a name="GDC-prerequisite"></a>GDC<dd>
In order to build GDC, the D compiler, you need a working GDC
compiler (GCC version 9.4 or later) and D runtime library,
`<samp><span class="samp">libphobos</span></samp>', as the D front end is written in D.

     <p>Versions of GDC prior to 12 can be built with an ISO C++11 compiler, which can
then be installed and used to bootstrap newer versions of the D front end.

     <p>It is strongly recommended to use an older version of GDC to build GDC. More
recent versions of GDC than the version built are not guaranteed to work and
will often fail during the build with compilation errors relating to
deprecations or removed features.

     <p>Note that <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> does not test whether the GDC installation works
and has a sufficiently recent version.  Though the implementation of the D
front end does not make use of any GDC-specific extensions, or novel features
of the D language, if too old a GDC version is installed and
<samp><span class="option">--enable-languages=d</span></samp> is used, the build will fail.

     <p>On some targets, `<samp><span class="samp">libphobos</span></samp>' isn't enabled by default, but compiles
and works if <samp><span class="option">--enable-libphobos</span></samp> is used.  Specifics are
documented for affected targets.

     <br><dt>A &ldquo;working&rdquo; POSIX compatible shell, or GNU bash<dd>
Necessary when running <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> because some
<samp><span class="command">/bin/sh</span></samp> shells have bugs and may crash when configuring the
target libraries.  In other cases, <samp><span class="command">/bin/sh</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">ksh</span></samp>
have disastrous corner-case performance problems.  This
can cause target <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> runs to literally take days to
complete in some cases.

     <p>So on some platforms <samp><span class="command">/bin/ksh</span></samp> is sufficient, on others it
isn't.  See the host/target specific instructions for your platform, or
use <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp> to be sure.  Then set <samp><span class="env">CONFIG_SHELL</span></samp> in your
environment to your &ldquo;good&rdquo; shell prior to running
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>/<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.

     <p><samp><span class="command">zsh</span></samp> is not a fully compliant POSIX shell and will not
work when configuring GCC.

     <br><dt>A POSIX or SVR4 awk<dd>
Necessary for creating some of the generated source files for GCC. 
If in doubt, use a recent GNU awk version, as some of the older ones
are broken.  GNU awk version 3.1.5 is known to work.

     <br><dt>GNU binutils<dd>
Necessary in some circumstances, optional in others.  See the
host/target specific instructions for your platform for the exact
requirements.

     <p>Note binutils 2.35 or newer is required for LTO to work correctly
with GNU libtool that includes doing a bootstrap with LTO enabled.

     <br><dt>gzip version 1.2.4 (or later) or<dt>bzip2 version 1.0.2 (or later)<dd>
Necessary to uncompress GCC <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> files when source code is
obtained via HTTPS mirror sites.

     <br><dt>GNU make version 3.80 (or later)<dd>
You must have GNU make installed to build GCC.

     <br><dt>GNU tar version 1.14 (or later)<dd>
Necessary (only on some platforms) to untar the source code.  Many
systems' <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> programs will also work, only try GNU
<samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> if you have problems.

     <br><dt>Perl version between 5.6.1 and 5.6.24<dd>
Necessary when targeting Darwin, building `<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++</span></samp>',
and not using <samp><span class="option">--disable-symvers</span></samp>. 
Necessary when targeting Solaris 2 with Solaris <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> and not using
<samp><span class="option">--disable-symvers</span></samp>.

     <p>Necessary when regenerating <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> dependencies in libiberty. 
Necessary when regenerating <samp><span class="file">libiberty/functions.texi</span></samp>. 
Necessary when generating manpages from Texinfo manuals. 
Used by various scripts to generate some files included in the source
repository (mainly Unicode-related and rarely changing) from source
tables.

     <p>Used by <samp><span class="command">automake</span></samp>.

</dl>

   <p>Several support libraries are necessary to build GCC, some are required,
others optional.  While any sufficiently new version of required tools
usually work, library requirements are generally stricter.  Newer
versions may work in some cases, but it's safer to use the exact
versions documented.  We appreciate bug reports about problems with
newer versions, though.  If your OS vendor provides packages for the
support libraries then using those packages may be the simplest way to
install the libraries.

     <dl>
<dt>GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP) version 4.3.2 (or later)<dd>
Necessary to build GCC.  If a GMP source distribution is found in a
subdirectory of your GCC sources named <samp><span class="file">gmp</span></samp>, it will be built
together with GCC.  Alternatively, if GMP is already installed but it
is not in your library search path, you will have to configure with the
<samp><span class="option">--with-gmp</span></samp> configure option.  See also <samp><span class="option">--with-gmp-lib</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">--with-gmp-include</span></samp>. 
The in-tree build is only supported with the GMP version that
download_prerequisites installs.

     <br><dt>MPFR Library version 3.1.0 (or later)<dd>
Necessary to build GCC.  It can be downloaded from
<a href="https://www.mpfr.org">https://www.mpfr.org</a>.  If an MPFR source distribution is found
in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named <samp><span class="file">mpfr</span></samp>, it will be
built together with GCC.  Alternatively, if MPFR is already installed
but it is not in your default library search path, the
<samp><span class="option">--with-mpfr</span></samp> configure option should be used.  See also
<samp><span class="option">--with-mpfr-lib</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--with-mpfr-include</span></samp>. 
The in-tree build is only supported with the MPFR version that
download_prerequisites installs.

     <br><dt>MPC Library version 1.0.1 (or later)<dd>
Necessary to build GCC.  It can be downloaded from
<a href="https://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/">https://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/</a>.  If an MPC source distribution
is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named <samp><span class="file">mpc</span></samp>, it
will be built together with GCC.  Alternatively, if MPC is already
installed but it is not in your default library search path, the
<samp><span class="option">--with-mpc</span></samp> configure option should be used.  See also
<samp><span class="option">--with-mpc-lib</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--with-mpc-include</span></samp>. 
The in-tree build is only supported with the MPC version that
download_prerequisites installs.

     <br><dt>isl Library version 0.15 or later.<dd>
Necessary to build GCC with the Graphite loop optimizations. 
It can be downloaded from <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/">https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/</a>. 
If an isl source distribution is found
in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named <samp><span class="file">isl</span></samp>, it will be
built together with GCC.  Alternatively, the <samp><span class="option">--with-isl</span></samp> configure
option should be used if isl is not installed in your default library
search path.

     <br><dt>zstd Library.<dd>
Necessary to build GCC with zstd compression used for LTO bytecode. 
The library is searched in your default library patch search. 
Alternatively, the <samp><span class="option">--with-zstd</span></samp> configure option should be used.
