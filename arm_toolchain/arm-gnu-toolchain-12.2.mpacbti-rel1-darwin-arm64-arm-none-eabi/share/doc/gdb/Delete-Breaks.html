<h4 class="subsection">5.1.4 Deleting Breakpoints</h4>

<p><a name="index-clearing-breakpoints_002c-watchpoints_002c-catchpoints-346"></a><a name="index-deleting-breakpoints_002c-watchpoints_002c-catchpoints-347"></a>It is often necessary to eliminate a breakpoint, watchpoint, or
catchpoint once it has done its job and you no longer want your program
to stop there.  This is called <dfn>deleting</dfn> the breakpoint.  A
breakpoint that has been deleted no longer exists; it is forgotten.

   <p>With the <code>clear</code> command you can delete breakpoints according to
where they are in your program.  With the <code>delete</code> command you can
delete individual breakpoints, watchpoints, or catchpoints by specifying
their breakpoint numbers.

   <p>It is not necessary to delete a breakpoint to proceed past it.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
automatically ignores breakpoints on the first instruction to be executed
when you continue execution without changing the execution address.

     
<a name="index-clear-348"></a>
<dl><dt><code>clear</code><dd>Delete any breakpoints at the next instruction to be executed in the
selected stack frame (see <a href="Selection.html#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>).  When
the innermost frame is selected, this is a good way to delete a
breakpoint where your program just stopped.

     <br><dt><code>clear </code><var>locspec</var><dd>Delete any breakpoint with a code location that corresponds to
<var>locspec</var>.  See <a href="Location-Specifications.html#Location-Specifications">Location Specifications</a>, for the various forms
of <var>locspec</var>.  Which code locations correspond to <var>locspec</var>
depends on the form used in the location specification <var>locspec</var>:

          <dl>
<dt><var>linenum</var><dt><var>filename</var><code>:</code><var>linenum</var><dt><code>-line </code><var>linenum</var><dt><code>-source </code><var>filename</var><code> -line </code><var>linenum</var><dd>If <var>locspec</var> specifies a line number, with or without a file name,
the command deletes any breakpoint with a code location that is at or
within the specified line <var>linenum</var> in files that match the
specified <var>filename</var>.  If <var>filename</var> is omitted, it defaults
to the current source file.

          <br><dt><code>*</code><var>address</var><dd>If <var>locspec</var> specifies an address, the command deletes any
breakpoint with a code location that is at the given <var>address</var>.

          <br><dt><var>function</var><dt><code>-function </code><var>function</var><dd>If <var>locspec</var> specifies a function, the command deletes any
breakpoint with a code location that is at the entry to any function
whose name matches <var>function</var>. 
</dl>

     <p>Ambiguity in names of files and functions can be resolved as described
in <a href="Location-Specifications.html#Location-Specifications">Location Specifications</a>.

list specified as argument.  If no argument is specified, delete all
breakpoints (<span class="sc">gdb</span> asks confirmation, unless you have <code>set
confirm off</code>).  You can abbreviate this command as <code>d</code>.
