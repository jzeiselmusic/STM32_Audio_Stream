<h3 class="section">3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</h3>

<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.

 <p><a name="index-file-name-suffix-83"></a>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

 <p><a name="index-x-84"></a>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-x </code><var>language</var><dd>Specify explicitly the <var>language</var> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option.  Possible values for <var>language</var> are:
     <pre class="smallexample">          c  c-header  cpp-output
          c++  c++-header  c++-system-header c++-user-header c++-cpp-output
          objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
          objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
          assembler  assembler-with-cpp
          ada
          d
          f77  f77-cpp-input f95  f95-cpp-input
          go
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-x none</code><dd>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp>
has not been used at all). 
</dl>

 <p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> (or filename suffixes) to tell <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> where to start, and
one of the options <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> to say where
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
`<samp><span class="samp">-x cpp-output -E</span></samp>') instruct <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> to do nothing at all.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd><a name="index-c-85"></a>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

     <p>By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix `<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.i</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.s</span></samp>', etc., with `<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>'.

     <p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-S</code><dd><a name="index-S-86"></a>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

     <p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix `<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.i</span></samp>', etc., with `<samp><span class="samp">.s</span></samp>'.

     <p>Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-E</code><dd><a name="index-E-87"></a>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

     <p>Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.

     <p><a name="index-output-file-option-88"></a><br><dt><code>-o </code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-o-89"></a>Place the primary output in file <var>file</var>.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an
object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <samp><span class="file">a.out</span></samp>, the object file for
<samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var></samp> in <samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.o</span></samp>, its
assembler file in <samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.s</span></samp>, a precompiled header file in
<samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var><span class="file">.gch</span></samp>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.

     <p>Though <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp> names only the primary output, it also affects the
naming of auxiliary and dump outputs.  See the examples below.  Unless
overridden, both auxiliary outputs and dump outputs are placed in the
same directory as the primary output.  In auxiliary outputs, the suffix
of the input file is replaced with that of the auxiliary output file
type; in dump outputs, the suffix of the dump file is appended to the
input file suffix.  In compilation commands, the base name of both
auxiliary and dump outputs is that of the primary output; in compile and
link commands, the primary output name, minus the executable suffix, is
combined with the input file name.  If both share the same base name,
disregarding the suffix, the result of the combination is that base
name, otherwise, they are concatenated, separated by a dash.

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c foo.c ...
     </pre>
     <p>will use <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> as the primary output, and place aux outputs and
dumps next to it, e.g., aux file <samp><span class="file">foo.dwo</span></samp> for
<samp><span class="option">-gsplit-dwarf</span></samp>, and dump file <samp><span class="file">foo.c.???r.final</span></samp> for
<samp><span class="option">-fdump-rtl-final</span></samp>.

     <p>If a non-linker output file is explicitly specified, aux and dump files
by default take the same base name:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c foo.c -o dir/foobar.o ...
     </pre>
     <p>will name aux outputs <samp><span class="file">dir/foobar.*</span></samp> and dump outputs
<samp><span class="file">dir/foobar.c.*</span></samp>.

     <p>A linker output will instead prefix aux and dump outputs:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c bar.c -o dir/foobar ...
     </pre>
     <p>will generally name aux outputs <samp><span class="file">dir/foobar-foo.*</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">dir/foobar-bar.*</span></samp>, and dump outputs <samp><span class="file">dir/foobar-foo.c.*</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">dir/foobar-bar.c.*</span></samp>.

     <p>The one exception to the above is when the executable shares the base
name with the single input:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c -o dir/foo ...
     </pre>
     <p>in which case aux outputs are named <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.*</span></samp> and dump outputs
named <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.c.*</span></samp>.

     <p>The location and the names of auxiliary and dump outputs can be adjusted
by the options <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase-ext</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-save-temps=cwd</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps=obj</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpbase </code><var>dumpbase</var><dd><a name="index-dumpbase-90"></a>This option sets the base name for auxiliary and dump output files.  It
does not affect the name of the primary output file.  Intermediate
outputs, when preserved, are not regarded as primary outputs, but as
auxiliary outputs:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -save-temps -S foo.c
     </pre>
     <p>saves the (no longer) temporary preprocessed file in <samp><span class="file">foo.i</span></samp>, and
then compiles to the (implied) output file <samp><span class="file">foo.s</span></samp>, whereas:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -save-temps -dumpbase save-foo -c foo.c
     </pre>
     <p>preprocesses to in <samp><span class="file">save-foo.i</span></samp>, compiles to <samp><span class="file">save-foo.s</span></samp> (now
an intermediate, thus auxiliary output), and then assembles to the
(implied) output file <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp>.

     <p>Absent this option, dump and aux files take their names from the input
file, or from the (non-linker) output file, if one is explicitly
specified: dump output files (e.g. those requested by <samp><span class="option">-fdump-*</span></samp>
options) with the input name suffix, and aux output files (those
requested by other non-dump options, e.g. <code>-save-temps</code>,
<code>-gsplit-dwarf</code>, <code>-fcallgraph-info</code>) without it.

     <p>Similar suffix differentiation of dump and aux outputs can be attained
for explicitly-given <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase basename.suf</span></samp> by also specifying
<samp><span class="option">-dumpbase-ext .suf</span></samp>.

     <p>If <var>dumpbase</var> is explicitly specified with any directory component,
any <var>dumppfx</var> specification (e.g. <samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps=*</span></samp>) is ignored, and instead of appending to it,
<var>dumpbase</var> fully overrides it:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c -c -o dir/foo.o -dumpbase alt/foo \
            -dumpdir pfx- -save-temps=cwd ...
     </pre>
     <p>creates auxiliary and dump outputs named <samp><span class="file">alt/foo.*</span></samp>, disregarding
<samp><span class="file">dir/</span></samp> in <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp>, the <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp> prefix implied by
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps=cwd</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">pfx-</span></samp> in <samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp>.

     <p>When <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> is specified in a command that compiles multiple
inputs, or that compiles and then links, it may be combined with
<var>dumppfx</var>, as specified under <samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp>.  Then, each input
file is compiled using the combined <var>dumppfx</var>, and default values
for <var>dumpbase</var> and <var>auxdropsuf</var> are computed for each input
file:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c bar.c -c -dumpbase main ...
     </pre>
     <p>creates <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp> as primary outputs, and avoids
overwriting the auxiliary and dump outputs by using the <var>dumpbase</var>
as a prefix, creating auxiliary and dump outputs named <samp><span class="file">main-foo.*</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">main-bar.*</span></samp>.

     <p>An empty string specified as <var>dumpbase</var> avoids the influence of the
output basename in the naming of auxiliary and dump outputs during
compilation, computing default values :

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c foo.c -o dir/foobar.o -dumpbase '' ...
     </pre>
     <p>will name aux outputs <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.*</span></samp> and dump outputs
<samp><span class="file">dir/foo.c.*</span></samp>.  Note how their basenames are taken from the input
name, but the directory still defaults to that of the output.

     <p>The empty-string dumpbase does not prevent the use of the output
basename for outputs during linking:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c bar.c -o dir/foobar -dumpbase '' -flto ...
     </pre>
     <p>The compilation of the source files will name auxiliary outputs
<samp><span class="file">dir/foo.*</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">dir/bar.*</span></samp>, and dump outputs
<samp><span class="file">dir/foo.c.*</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">dir/bar.c.*</span></samp>.  LTO recompilation during
linking will use <samp><span class="file">dir/foobar.</span></samp> as the prefix for dumps and
auxiliary files.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpbase-ext </code><var>auxdropsuf</var><dd><a name="index-dumpbase_002dext-91"></a>When forming the name of an auxiliary (but not a dump) output file, drop
trailing <var>auxdropsuf</var> from <var>dumpbase</var> before appending any
suffixes.  If not specified, this option defaults to the suffix of a
default <var>dumpbase</var>, i.e., the suffix of the input file when
<samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> is not present in the command line, or <var>dumpbase</var>
is combined with <var>dumppfx</var>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c -c -o dir/foo.o -dumpbase x-foo.c -dumpbase-ext .c ...
     </pre>
     <p>creates <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.o</span></samp> as the main output, and generates auxiliary
outputs in <samp><span class="file">dir/x-foo.*</span></samp>, taking the location of the primary
output, and dropping the <samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp> suffix from the <var>dumpbase</var>.  Dump
outputs retain the suffix: <samp><span class="file">dir/x-foo.c.*</span></samp>.

     <p>This option is disregarded if it does not match the suffix of a
specified <var>dumpbase</var>, except as an alternative to the executable
suffix when appending the linker output base name to <var>dumppfx</var>, as
specified below:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c bar.c -o main.out -dumpbase-ext .out ...
     </pre>
     <p>creates <samp><span class="file">main.out</span></samp> as the primary output, and avoids overwriting
the auxiliary and dump outputs by using the executable name minus
<var>auxdropsuf</var> as a prefix, creating auxiliary outputs named
<samp><span class="file">main-foo.*</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">main-bar.*</span></samp> and dump outputs named
<samp><span class="file">main-foo.c.*</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">main-bar.c.*</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpdir </code><var>dumppfx</var><dd><a name="index-dumpdir-92"></a>When forming the name of an auxiliary or dump output file, use
<var>dumppfx</var> as a prefix:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -dumpdir pfx- -c foo.c ...
     </pre>
     <p>creates <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> as the primary output, and auxiliary outputs named
<samp><span class="file">pfx-foo.*</span></samp>, combining the given <var>dumppfx</var> with the default
<var>dumpbase</var> derived from the default primary output, derived in turn
from the input name.  Dump outputs also take the input name suffix:
<samp><span class="file">pfx-foo.c.*</span></samp>.

     <p>If <var>dumppfx</var> is to be used as a directory name, it must end with a
directory separator:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -dumpdir dir/ -c foo.c -o obj/bar.o ...
     </pre>
     <p>creates <samp><span class="file">obj/bar.o</span></samp> as the primary output, and auxiliary outputs
named <samp><span class="file">dir/bar.*</span></samp>, combining the given <var>dumppfx</var> with the
default <var>dumpbase</var> derived from the primary output name.  Dump
outputs also take the input name suffix: <samp><span class="file">dir/bar.c.*</span></samp>.

     <p>It defaults to the location of the output file, unless the output
file is a special file like <code>/dev/null</code>. Options
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps=cwd</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-save-temps=obj</span></samp> override this
default, just like an explicit <samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> option.  In case
multiple such options are given, the last one prevails:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -dumpdir pfx- -c foo.c -save-temps=obj ...
     </pre>
     <p>outputs <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp>, with auxiliary outputs named <samp><span class="file">foo.*</span></samp> because
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps=*</span></samp> overrides the <var>dumppfx</var> given by the earlier
<samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> option.  It does not matter that <samp><span class="option">=obj</span></samp> is the
default for <samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp>, nor that the output directory is
implicitly the current directory.  Dump outputs are named
<samp><span class="file">foo.c.*</span></samp>.

     <p>When compiling from multiple input files, if <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> is
specified, <var>dumpbase</var>, minus a <var>auxdropsuf</var> suffix, and a dash
are appended to (or override, if containing any directory components) an
explicit or defaulted <var>dumppfx</var>, so that each of the multiple
compilations gets differently-named aux and dump outputs.

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c bar.c -c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -dumpbase main ...
     </pre>
     <p>outputs auxiliary dumps to <samp><span class="file">dir/pfx-main-foo.*</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">dir/pfx-main-bar.*</span></samp>, appending <var>dumpbase</var>- to <var>dumppfx</var>. 
Dump outputs retain the input file suffix: <samp><span class="file">dir/pfx-main-foo.c.*</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">dir/pfx-main-bar.c.*</span></samp>, respectively.  Contrast with the
single-input compilation:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c -c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -dumpbase main ...
     </pre>
     <p>that, applying <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> to a single source, does not compute
and append a separate <var>dumpbase</var> per input file.  Its auxiliary and
dump outputs go in <samp><span class="file">dir/pfx-main.*</span></samp>.

     <p>When compiling and then linking from multiple input files, a defaulted
or explicitly specified <var>dumppfx</var> also undergoes the <var>dumpbase</var>-
transformation above (e.g. the compilation of <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">bar.c</span></samp> above, but without <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp>).  If neither
<samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> nor <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> are given, the linker output
base name, minus <var>auxdropsuf</var>, if specified, or the executable
suffix otherwise, plus a dash is appended to the default <var>dumppfx</var>
instead.  Note, however, that unlike earlier cases of linking:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c bar.c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -o main ...
     </pre>
     <p>does not append the output name <samp><span class="file">main</span></samp> to <var>dumppfx</var>, because
<samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> is explicitly specified.  The goal is that the
explicitly-specified <var>dumppfx</var> may contain the specified output name
as part of the prefix, if desired; only an explicitly-specified
<samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> would be combined with it, in order to avoid simply
discarding a meaningful option.

     <p>When compiling and then linking from a single input file, the linker
output base name will only be appended to the default <var>dumppfx</var> as
above if it does not share the base name with the single input file
name.  This has been covered in single-input linking cases above, but
not with an explicit <samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> that inhibits the combination,
even if overridden by <samp><span class="option">-save-temps=*</span></samp>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc foo.c -dumpdir alt/pfx- -o dir/main.exe -save-temps=cwd ...
     </pre>
     <p>Auxiliary outputs are named <samp><span class="file">foo.*</span></samp>, and dump outputs
<samp><span class="file">foo.c.*</span></samp>, in the current working directory as ultimately requested
by <samp><span class="option">-save-temps=cwd</span></samp>.

     <p>Summing it all up for an intuitive though slightly imprecise data flow:
the primary output name is broken into a directory part and a basename
part; <var>dumppfx</var> is set to the former, unless overridden by
<samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-save-temps=*</span></samp>, and <var>dumpbase</var> is set
to the latter, unless overriden by <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp>.  If there are
multiple inputs or linking, this <var>dumpbase</var> may be combined with
<var>dumppfx</var> and taken from each input file.  Auxiliary output names
for each input are formed by combining <var>dumppfx</var>, <var>dumpbase</var>
minus suffix, and the auxiliary output suffix; dump output names are
only different in that the suffix from <var>dumpbase</var> is retained.

     <p>When it comes to auxiliary and dump outputs created during LTO
recompilation, a combination of <var>dumppfx</var> and <var>dumpbase</var>, as
given or as derived from the linker output name but not from inputs,
even in cases in which this combination would not otherwise be used as
such, is passed down with a trailing period replacing the compiler-added
dash, if any, as a <samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp> option to <samp><span class="command">lto-wrapper</span></samp>;
being involved in linking, this program does not normally get any
<samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-dumpbase-ext</span></samp>, and it ignores them.

     <p>When running sub-compilers, <samp><span class="command">lto-wrapper</span></samp> appends LTO stage
names to the received <var>dumppfx</var>, ensures it contains a directory
component so that it overrides any <samp><span class="option">-dumpdir</span></samp>, and passes that as
<samp><span class="option">-dumpbase</span></samp> to sub-compilers.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd><a name="index-v-93"></a>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

     <br><dt><code>-###</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023_0023_0023-94"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or <code>./-_</code>. 
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.

     <br><dt><code>--help</code><dd><a name="index-help-95"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>.  If the <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> option is also specified
then <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> option has also been specified
(prior to the <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.

     <br><dt><code>--target-help</code><dd><a name="index-target_002dhelp-96"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.

     <br><dt><code>--help={</code><var>class</var><span class="roman">|[</span><code>^</code><span class="roman">]</span><var>qualifier</var><code>}</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>,...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">optimizers</span></samp>'<dd>Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">warnings</span></samp>'<dd>Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">target</span></samp>'<dd>Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
<samp><span class="option">--target-help</span></samp> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> syntax.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">params</span></samp>'<dd>Display the values recognized by the <samp><span class="option">--param</span></samp>
option.

          <br><dt><var>language</var><dd>Display the options supported for <var>language</var>, where
<var>language</var> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC.  If an option is supported by all languages, one needs
to select `<samp><span class="samp">common</span></samp>' class.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">common</span></samp>'<dd>Display the options that are common to all languages. 
</dl>

     <p>These are the supported qualifiers:

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">undocumented</span></samp>'<dd>Display only those options that are undocumented.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">joined</span></samp>'<dd>Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
`<samp><span class="samp">--help=target</span></samp>'.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">separate</span></samp>'<dd>Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: `<samp><span class="samp">-o output-file</span></samp>'. 
</dl>

     <p>Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=target,undocumented
     </pre>
     <p>The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
`<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
     </pre>
     <p>The argument to <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.

     <p>Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
<var>target</var>.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=target,optimizers
     </pre>
     <p>The <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.  If <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> is also
specified anywhere on the command line then this takes precedence
over any <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> option.

     <p>If the <samp><span class="option">-Q</span></samp> option appears on the command line before the
<samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> option, then the descriptive text displayed by
<samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> option is used).

     <p>Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>:

     <pre class="smallexample">            % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
            The following options are target specific:
            -mabi=                                2
            -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
            -mapcs                                [disabled]
     </pre>
     <p>The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> by using:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -Q -O2 --help=optimizers
     </pre>
     <p>Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> by using:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
          gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts
          diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled
