<h3 class="section">3.9 Options That Control Static Analysis</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fanalyzer</code><dd><a name="index-analyzer-971"></a><a name="index-fanalyzer-972"></a><a name="index-fno_002danalyzer-973"></a>This option enables an static analysis of program flow which looks
for &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; interprocedural paths through the
code, and issues warnings for problems found on them.

     <p>This analysis is much more expensive than other GCC warnings.

     <p>Enabling this option effectively enables the following warnings:

     <pre class="smallexample">          
          -Wanalyzer-double-fclose 
          -Wanalyzer-double-free

          -Wanalyzer-file-leak 
          -Wanalyzer-free-of-non-heap 
          -Wanalyzer-malloc-leak 
          -Wanalyzer-mismatching-deallocation 
          -Wanalyzer-null-argument 
          -Wanalyzer-null-dereference 
          -Wanalyzer-possible-null-argument 
          -Wanalyzer-possible-null-dereference 
          -Wanalyzer-shift-count-negative 
          -Wanalyzer-shift-count-overflow 
          -Wanalyzer-stale-setjmp-buffer 
          -Wanalyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler

          -Wanalyzer-use-of-uninitialized-value 
          -Wanalyzer-write-to-const 
          -Wanalyzer-write-to-string-literal 
          
     </pre>
     <p>This option is only available if GCC was configured with analyzer
support enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-Wanalyzer-too-complex</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dtoo_002dcomplex-974"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dtoo_002dcomplex-975"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp> is enabled, the analyzer uses various heuristics
to attempt to explore the control flow and data flow in the program,
but these can be defeated by sufficiently complicated code.

     <p>By default, the analysis silently stops if the code is too
complicated for the analyzer to fully explore and it reaches an internal
limit.  The <samp><span class="option">-Wanalyzer-too-complex</span></samp> option warns if this occurs.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-double-fclose</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002ddouble_002dfclose-976"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002ddouble_002dfclose-977"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-double-fclose</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a <code>FILE *</code>
can have <code>fclose</code> called on it more than once.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-double-free</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002ddouble_002dfree-978"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002ddouble_002dfree-979"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-double-free</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a pointer
can have a deallocator called on it more than once, either <code>free</code>,
or a deallocator referenced by attribute <code>malloc</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-exposure-through-output-file</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dexposure_002dthrough_002doutput_002dfile-980"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dexposure_002dthrough_002doutput_002dfile-981"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-exposure-through-output-file</span></samp>
to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
security-sensitive value is written to an output file
(such as writing a password to a log file).

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-file-leak</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dfile_002dleak-982"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dfile_002dleak-983"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-file-leak</span></samp>
to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
<code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> <code>FILE *</code> stream object is leaked.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-free-of-non-heap</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dfree_002dof_002dnon_002dheap-984"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dfree_002dof_002dnon_002dheap-985"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-free-of-non-heap</span></samp>
to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which <code>free</code>
is called on a non-heap pointer (e.g. an on-stack buffer, or a global).

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-malloc-leak</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dmalloc_002dleak-986"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dmalloc_002dleak-987"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-malloc-leak</span></samp>
to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
pointer allocated via an allocator is leaked: either <code>malloc</code>,
or a function marked with attribute <code>malloc</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-mismatching-deallocation</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dmismatching_002ddeallocation-988"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dmismatching_002ddeallocation-989"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-mismatching-deallocation</span></samp>
to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which the
wrong deallocation function is called on a pointer value, based on
which function was used to allocate the pointer value.  The diagnostic
will warn about mismatches between <code>free</code>, scalar <code>delete</code>
and vector <code>delete[]</code>, and those marked as allocator/deallocator
pairs using attribute <code>malloc</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-argument</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dpossible_002dnull_002dargument-990"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dpossible_002dnull_002dargument-991"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-argument</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
possibly-NULL value is passed to a function argument marked
with <code>__attribute__((nonnull))</code> as requiring a non-NULL
value.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-dereference</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dpossible_002dnull_002ddereference-992"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dpossible_002dnull_002ddereference-993"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-dereference</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
possibly-NULL value is dereferenced.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-null-argument</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dnull_002dargument-994"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dnull_002dargument-995"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-null-argument</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
value known to be NULL is passed to a function argument marked
with <code>__attribute__((nonnull))</code> as requiring a non-NULL
value.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-null-dereference</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dnull_002ddereference-996"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dnull_002ddereference-997"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-null-dereference</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
value known to be NULL is dereferenced.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-negative</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dshift_002dcount_002dnegative-998"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dshift_002dcount_002dnegative-999"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-negative</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
shift is attempted with a negative count.  It is analogous to
the <samp><span class="option">-Wshift-count-negative</span></samp> diagnostic implemented in
the C/C++ front ends, but is implemented based on analyzing
interprocedural paths, rather than merely parsing the syntax tree. 
However, the analyzer does not prioritize detection of such paths, so
false negatives are more likely relative to other warnings.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dshift_002dcount_002doverflow-1000"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dshift_002dcount_002doverflow-1001"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-overflow</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
shift is attempted with a count greater than or equal to the
precision of the operand's type.  It is analogous to
the <samp><span class="option">-Wshift-count-overflow</span></samp> diagnostic implemented in
the C/C++ front ends, but is implemented based on analyzing
interprocedural paths, rather than merely parsing the syntax tree. 
However, the analyzer does not prioritize detection of such paths, so
false negatives are more likely relative to other warnings.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-stale-setjmp-buffer</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dstale_002dsetjmp_002dbuffer-1002"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dstale_002dsetjmp_002dbuffer-1003"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-stale-setjmp-buffer</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which
<code>longjmp</code> is called to rewind to a <code>jmp_buf</code> relating
to a <code>setjmp</code> call in a function that has returned.

     <p>When <code>setjmp</code> is called on a <code>jmp_buf</code> to record a rewind
location, it records the stack frame.  The stack frame becomes invalid
when the function containing the <code>setjmp</code> call returns.  Attempting
to rewind to it via <code>longjmp</code> would reference a stack frame that
no longer exists, and likely lead to a crash (or worse).

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-allocation-size</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dtainted_002dallocation_002dsize-1004"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dtainted_002dallocation_002dsize-1005"></a>This warning requires both <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer-checker=taint</span></samp> to enable it;
use <samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-tainted-allocation-size</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value
that could be under an attacker's control is used as the size
of an allocation without being sanitized, so that an attacker could
inject an excessively large allocation and potentially cause a denial
of service attack.

     <p>See <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/789.html">CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-array-index</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dtainted_002darray_002dindex-1006"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dtainted_002darray_002dindex-1007"></a>This warning requires both <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer-checker=taint</span></samp> to enable it;
use <samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-tainted-array-index</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value
that could be under an attacker's control is used as the index
of an array access without being sanitized, so that an attacker
could inject an out-of-bounds access.

     <p>See <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html">CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-divisor</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dtainted_002ddivisor-1008"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dtainted_002ddivisor-1009"></a>This warning requires both <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer-checker=taint</span></samp> to enable it;
use <samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-tainted-divisor</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value
that could be under an attacker's control is used as the divisor
in a division or modulus operation without being sanitized, so that
an attacker could inject a division-by-zero.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-offset</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dtainted_002doffset-1010"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dtainted_002doffset-1011"></a>This warning requires both <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer-checker=taint</span></samp> to enable it;
use <samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-tainted-offset</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value
that could be under an attacker's control is used as a pointer offset
without being sanitized, so that an attacker could inject an out-of-bounds
access.

     <p>See <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/823.html">CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-size</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dtainted_002dsize-1012"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dtainted_002dsize-1013"></a>This warning requires both <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer-checker=taint</span></samp> to enable it;
use <samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-tainted-size</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value
that could be under an attacker's control is used as the size of
an operation such as <code>memset</code> without being sanitized, so that an
attacker could inject an out-of-bounds access.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dunsafe_002dcall_002dwithin_002dsignal_002dhandler-1014"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dunsafe_002dcall_002dwithin_002dsignal_002dhandler-1015"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
function known to be async-signal-unsafe (such as <code>fprintf</code>) is
called from a signal handler.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-use-after-free</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002duse_002dafter_002dfree-1016"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002duse_002dafter_002dfree-1017"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-use-after-free</span></samp> to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a
pointer is used after a deallocator is called on it: either <code>free</code>,
or a deallocator referenced by attribute <code>malloc</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-use-of-pointer-in-stale-stack-frame</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002duse_002dof_002dpointer_002din_002dstale_002dstack_002dframe-1018"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002duse_002dof_002dpointer_002din_002dstale_002dstack_002dframe-1019"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-use-of-pointer-in-stale-stack-frame</span></samp>
to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a pointer
is dereferenced that points to a variable in a stale stack frame.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-write-to-const</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dwrite_002dto_002dconst-1020"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dwrite_002dto_002dconst-1021"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-analyzer-write-to-const</span></samp>
to disable it.

     <p>This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which the analyzer
detects an attempt to write through a pointer to a <code>const</code> object. 
However, the analyzer does not prioritize detection of such paths, so
false negatives are more likely relative to other warnings.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-analyzer-write-to-string-literal</code><dd><a name="index-Wanalyzer_002dwrite_002dto_002dstring_002dliteral-1022"></a><a name="index-Wno_002danalyzer_002dwrite_002dto_002dstring_002dliteral-1023"></a>This warning requires <samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer</span></samp>, which enables it; use

     <p>By default the analyzer verifies that there is a feasible control flow path
for each diagnostic it emits: that the conditions that hold are not mutually
exclusive.  Diagnostics for which no feasible path can be found are rejected. 
This filtering can be suppressed with <samp><span class="option">-fno-analyzer-feasibility</span></samp>, for
debugging issues in this code.

     <br><dt><code>-fanalyzer-fine-grained</code><dd><a name="index-fanalyzer_002dfine_002dgrained-1031"></a><a name="index-fno_002danalyzer_002dfine_002dgrained-1032"></a>This option is intended for analyzer developers.

     <p>Internally the analyzer builds an &ldquo;exploded graph&rdquo; that combines
control flow graphs with data flow information.

     <p>By default, an edge in this graph can contain the effects of a run
of multiple statements within a basic block.  With
<samp><span class="option">-fanalyzer-fine-grained</span></samp>, each statement gets its own edge.

     <br><dt><code>-fanalyzer-show-duplicate-count</code><dd><a name="index-fanalyzer_002dshow_002dduplicate_002dcount-1033"></a><a name="index-fno_002danalyzer_002dshow_002dduplicate_002dcount-1034"></a>This option is intended for analyzer developers: if multiple diagnostics
have been detected as being duplicates of each other, it emits a note when
reporting the best diagnostic, giving the number of additional diagnostics
that were suppressed by the deduplication logic.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-analyzer-state-merge</code><dd><a name="index-fanalyzer_002dstate_002dmerge-1035"></a><a name="index-fno_002danalyzer_002dstate_002dmerge-1036"></a>This option is intended for analyzer developers.

     <p>By default the analyzer attempts to simplify analysis by merging
sufficiently similar states at each program point as it builds its
&ldquo;exploded graph&rdquo;.  With <samp><span class="option">-fno-analyzer-state-merge</span></samp> this
merging can be suppressed, for debugging state-handling issues.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-analyzer-state-purge</code><dd><a name="index-fanalyzer_002dstate_002dpurge-1037"></a><a name="index-fno_002danalyzer_002dstate_002dpurge-1038"></a>This option is intended for analyzer developers.

     <p>By default the analyzer attempts to simplify analysis by purging
aspects of state at a program point that appear to no longer be relevant
e.g. the values of locals that aren't accessed later in the function
and which aren't relevant to leak analysis.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fno-analyzer-state-purge</span></samp> this purging of state can
be suppressed, for debugging state-handling issues.

     <br><dt><code>-fanalyzer-transitivity</code><dd><a name="index-fanalyzer_002dtransitivity-1039"></a><a name="index-fno_002danalyzer_002dtransitivity-1040"></a>This option enables transitivity of constraints within the analyzer.

     <br><dt><code>-fanalyzer-verbose-edges</code><dd>This option is intended for analyzer developers.  It enables more
verbose, lower-level detail in the descriptions of control flow
within diagnostic paths.

     <br><dt><code>-fanalyzer-verbose-state-changes</code><dd>This option is intended for analyzer developers.  It enables more
verbose, lower-level detail in the descriptions of events relating
to state machines within diagnostic paths.

     <br><dt><code>-fanalyzer-verbosity=</code><var>level</var><dd>This option controls the complexity of the control flow paths that are
emitted for analyzer diagnostics.

     <p>The <var>level</var> can be one of:

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>'<dd>At this level, interprocedural call and return events are displayed,
along with the most pertinent state-change events relating to
a diagnostic.  For example, for a double-<code>free</code> diagnostic,
both calls to <code>free</code> will be shown.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'<dd>As per the previous level, but also show events for the entry
to each function.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>'<dd>As per the previous level, but also show events relating to
control flow that are significant to triggering the issue
(e.g. &ldquo;true path taken&rdquo; at a conditional).

          <p>This level is the default.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>'<dd>As per the previous level, but show all control flow events, not
just significant ones.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>'<dd>This level is intended for analyzer developers; it adds various
other events intended for debugging the analyzer.
