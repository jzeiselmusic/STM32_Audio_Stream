<h3 class="section">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-C_002b_002b-165"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-options_002c-command_002dline-166"></a><a name="index-options_002c-C_002b_002b-167"></a>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <samp><span class="file">firstClass.C</span></samp> like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In this example, only <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-enums</span></samp> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

 <p>Some options for compiling C programs, such as <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp>, are also
relevant for C++ programs. 
See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

 <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fabi-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dversion-168"></a>Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.

     <p>Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.

     <p>Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.

     <p>Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.

     <p>Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.

     <p>Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.

     <p>Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.

     <p>Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and &ndash;, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.

     <p>Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a
builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.

     <p>Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.

     <p>Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
<code>nullptr_t</code>.

     <p>Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention
attributes (e.g. `<samp><span class="samp">stdcall</span></samp>').

     <p>Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of
sizeof... expressions and operator names.  For multiple entities with
the same name within a function, that are declared in different scopes,
the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also
implies <samp><span class="option">-fnew-inheriting-ctors</span></samp>.

     <p>Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the calling
conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target and for classes
with only deleted copy/move constructors.  It accidentally changes the
calling convention for classes with a deleted copy constructor and a
trivial move constructor.

     <p>Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental
change in version 12.

     <p>Version 14, which first appeared in G++ 10, corrects the mangling of
the nullptr expression.

     <p>Version 15, which first appeared in G++ 11, changes the mangling of
<code>__alignof__</code> to be distinct from that of <code>alignof</code>, and
dependent operator names.

     <p>See also <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fabi-compat-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dcompat_002dversion-169"></a>On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name. 
This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the alias.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=0</span></samp> (the default), this defaults to 11 (GCC 7
compatibility).  If another ABI version is explicitly selected, this
defaults to 0.  For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through 4.9,
use <samp><span class="option">-fabi-compat-version=2</span></samp>.

     <p>If this option is not provided but <samp><span class="option">-Wabi=</span><var>n</var></samp> is, that
version is used for compatibility aliases.  If this option is provided
along with <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> (without the version), the version from this
option is used for the warning.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-access-control</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002daccess_002dcontrol-170"></a><a name="index-faccess_002dcontrol-171"></a>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.

     <br><dt><code>-faligned-new</code><dd><a name="index-faligned_002dnew-172"></a>Enable support for C++17 <code>new</code> of types that require more
alignment than <code>void* ::operator new(std::size_t)</code> provides.  A
numeric argument such as <code>-faligned-new=32</code> can be used to
specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function,
but few users will need to override the default of
<code>alignof(std::max_align_t)</code>.

     <p>This flag is enabled by default for <samp><span class="option">-std=c++17</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fchar8_t</code><dt><code>-fno-char8_t</code><dd><a name="index-fchar8_005ft-173"></a><a name="index-fno_002dchar8_005ft-174"></a>Enable support for <code>char8_t</code> as adopted for C++20.  This includes
the addition of a new <code>char8_t</code> fundamental type, changes to the
types of UTF-8 string and character literals, new signatures for
user-defined literals, associated standard library updates, and new
<code>__cpp_char8_t</code> and <code>__cpp_lib_char8_t</code> feature test macros.

     <p>This option enables functions to be overloaded for ordinary and UTF-8
strings:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int f(const char *);    // #1
          int f(const char8_t *); // #2
          int v1 = f("text");     // Calls #1
          int v2 = f(u8"text");   // Calls #2
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">and introduces new signatures for user-defined literals:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int operator""_udl1(char8_t);
          int v3 = u8'x'_udl1;
          int operator""_udl2(const char8_t*, std::size_t);
          int v4 = u8"text"_udl2;
          template&lt;typename T, T...&gt; int operator""_udl3();
          int v5 = u8"text"_udl3;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">The change to the types of UTF-8 string and character literals introduces
incompatibilities with ISO C++11 and later standards.  For example, the
following code is well-formed under ISO C++11, but is ill-formed when
<samp><span class="option">-fchar8_t</span></samp> is specified.

     <pre class="smallexample">          char ca[] = u8"xx";     // error: char-array initialized from wide
                                  //        string
          const char *cp = u8"xx";// error: invalid conversion from
                                  //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
          int f(const char*);
          auto v = f(u8"xx");     // error: invalid conversion from
                                  //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
          std::string s{u8"xx"};  // error: no matching function for call to
                                  //        `std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;::basic_string()'
          using namespace std::literals;
          s = u8"xx"s;            // error: conversion from
                                  //        `basic_string&lt;char8_t&gt;' to non-scalar
                                  //        type `basic_string&lt;char&gt;' requested
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-fcheck-new</code><dd><a name="index-fcheck_002dnew-175"></a>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<code>operator new</code> only returns <code>0</code> if it is declared
<code>throw()</code>, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<code>operator new</code> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <code>std::bad_alloc</code>.  See also
`<samp><span class="samp">new (nothrow)</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><code>-fconcepts</code><dt><code>-fconcepts-ts</code><dd><a name="index-fconcepts-176"></a><a name="index-fconcepts_002dts-177"></a>Below <samp><span class="option">-std=c++20</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fconcepts</span></samp> enables support for the
C++ Extensions for Concepts Technical Specification, ISO 19217 (2015).

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-std=c++20</span></samp> and above, Concepts are part of the language
standard, so <samp><span class="option">-fconcepts</span></samp> defaults to on.  But the standard
specification of Concepts differs significantly from the TS, so some
constructs that were allowed in the TS but didn't make it into the
standard can still be enabled by <samp><span class="option">-fconcepts-ts</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-depth=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002ddepth-178"></a>Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.

     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-cache-depth=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002dcache_002ddepth-179"></a>Set the maximum level of nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr
functions that will be cached to <var>n</var>.  This is a heuristic that
trades off compilation speed (when the cache avoids repeated
calculations) against memory consumption (when the cache grows very
large from highly recursive evaluations).  The default is 8.  Very few
users are likely to want to adjust it, but if your code does heavy
constexpr calculations you might want to experiment to find which
value works best for you.

     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-fp-except</code><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002dfp_002dexcept-180"></a>Annex F of the C standard specifies that IEC559 floating point
exceptions encountered at compile time should not stop compilation. 
C++ compilers have historically not followed this guidance, instead
treating floating point division by zero as non-constant even though
it has a well defined value.  This flag tells the compiler to give
Annex F priority over other rules saying that a particular operation
is undefined.

     <pre class="smallexample">          constexpr float inf = 1./0.; // OK with -fconstexpr-fp-except
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-loop-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002dloop_002dlimit-181"></a>Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C++14 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect infinite loops during
constant expression evaluation.  The default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).

     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-ops-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002dops_002dlimit-182"></a>Set the maximum number of operations during a single constexpr evaluation. 
Even when number of iterations of a single loop is limited with the above limit,
if there are several nested loops and each of them has many iterations but still
smaller than the above limit, or if in a body of some loop or even outside
of a loop too many expressions need to be evaluated, the resulting constexpr
evaluation might take too long. 
The default is 33554432 (1&lt;&lt;25).

     <br><dt><code>-fcoroutines</code><dd><a name="index-fcoroutines-183"></a>Enable support for the C++ coroutines extension (experimental).

     <br><dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002delide_002dconstructors-184"></a><a name="index-felide_002dconstructors-185"></a>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type. 
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++
to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.

     <p>In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this
option still affects trivial member functions.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002denforce_002deh_002dspecs-186"></a><a name="index-fenforce_002deh_002dspecs-187"></a>Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<code>NDEBUG</code>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.

     <br><dt><code>-fextern-tls-init</code><dt><code>-fno-extern-tls-init</code><dd><a name="index-fextern_002dtls_002dinit-188"></a><a name="index-fno_002dextern_002dtls_002dinit-189"></a>The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow <code>thread_local</code> and
<code>threadprivate</code> variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization. 
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in
another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span></samp> option.

     <p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<samp><span class="option">-fextern-tls-init</span></samp>.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffold-simple-inlines</code><dt><code>-fno-fold-simple-inlines</code><dd><a name="index-ffold_002dsimple_002dinlines-190"></a><a name="index-fno_002dfold_002dsimple_002dinlines-191"></a>Permit the C++ frontend to fold calls to <code>std::move</code>, <code>std::forward</code>,
<code>std::addressof</code> and <code>std::as_const</code>.  In contrast to inlining, this
means no debug information will be generated for such calls.  Since these
functions are rarely interesting to debug, this flag is enabled by default
unless <samp><span class="option">-fno-inline</span></samp> is active.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dgnu_002dkeywords-192"></a><a name="index-fgnu_002dkeywords-193"></a>Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <code>__typeof__</code> instead. 
This option is implied by the strict ISO C++ dialects: <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-std=c++98</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-std=c++11</span></samp>, etc.

     <br><dt><code>-fimplicit-constexpr</code><dd><a name="index-fimplicit_002dconstexpr-194"></a>Make inline functions implicitly constexpr, if they satisfy the
requirements for a constexpr function.  This option can be used in
C++14 mode or later.  This can result in initialization changing from
dynamic to static and other optimizations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates-195"></a><a name="index-fimplicit_002dtemplates-196"></a>Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations. 
If you use this option, you must take care to structure your code to
include all the necessary explicit instantiations to avoid getting
undefined symbols at link time. 
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates-197"></a><a name="index-fimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates-198"></a>Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either. 
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization need the same set of explicit instantiations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines-199"></a><a name="index-fimplement_002dinlines-200"></a>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <code>#pragma implementation</code>.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodules-ts</code><dt><code>-fno-modules-ts</code><dd><a name="index-fmodules_002dts-201"></a><a name="index-fno_002dmodules_002dts-202"></a>Enable support for C++20 modules (see <a href="C_002b_002b-Modules.html#C_002b_002b-Modules">C++ Modules</a>).  The
<samp><span class="option">-fno-modules-ts</span></samp> is usually not needed, as that is the
default.  Even though this is a C++20 feature, it is not currently
implicitly enabled by selecting that standard version.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodule-header</code><dt><code>-fmodule-header=user</code><dt><code>-fmodule-header=system</code><dd><a name="index-fmodule_002dheader-203"></a>Compile a header file to create an importable header unit.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodule-implicit-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fmodule_002dimplicit_002dinline-204"></a>Member functions defined in their class definitions are not implicitly
inline for modular code.  This is different to traditional C++
behavior, for good reasons.  However, it may result in a difficulty
during code porting.  This option makes such function definitions
implicitly inline.  It does however generate an ABI incompatibility,
so you must use it everywhere or nowhere.  (Such definitions outside
of a named module remain implicitly inline, regardless.)

     <br><dt><code>-fno-module-lazy</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dmodule_002dlazy-205"></a><a name="index-fmodule_002dlazy-206"></a>Disable lazy module importing and module mapper creation.

If

and if that is unset, an in-process default is provided.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodule-only</code><dd><a name="index-fmodule_002donly-209"></a>Only emit the Compiled Module Interface, inhibiting any object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-210"></a>Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit

     <br><dt><code>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</code><dd><a name="index-fnew_002dinheriting_002dctors-211"></a>Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C++11 constructor

unless <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=10</span></samp> or lower is specified.

     <br><dt><code>-fnew-ttp-matching</code><dd><a name="index-fnew_002dttp_002dmatching-212"></a>Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template template

involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these

A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect

pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.

     <p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<code>__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))</code> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.

     <p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.

     <p>You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.

     <p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.

     <br><dt><code>-fvisibility-ms-compat</code><dd><a name="index-fvisibility_002dms_002dcompat-236"></a>This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

     <p>The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It sets the default visibility to <code>hidden</code>, like
<samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp>.

          <li>Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

          <li>The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
          </ol>

     <p>In new code it is better to use <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible. 
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.

     <p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.

          <ul>
<li>If a function returns a temporary <code>initializer_list</code>, or a local
<code>initializer_list</code> variable, the array's lifetime ends at the end
of the return statement, so the value returned has a dangling pointer.

          <li>If a new-expression creates an <code>initializer_list</code>, the array only
lives until the end of the enclosing full-expression, so the
<code>initializer_list</code> in the heap has a dangling pointer.

          <li>When an <code>initializer_list</code> variable is assigned from a
brace-enclosed initializer list, the temporary array created for the
right side of the assignment only lives until the end of the
full-expression, so at the next statement the <code>initializer_list</code>
variable has a dangling pointer.

          <li>When a list constructor stores the <code>begin</code> pointer from the

a move operation would have been performed even without the <code>std::move</code>
call.  This happens because the compiler is forced to treat the object as if
it were an rvalue in certain situations such as returning a local variable,
where copy elision isn't applicable.  Consider:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct T {
          ...
          };
          T fn(T t)

            return std::move (t);
          }
     </pre>
     <p>Here, the <code>std::move</code> call is redundant.  Because G++ implements Core
Issue 1579, another example is:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct T { // convertible to U
          ...
          };
          struct U {

            ...
            return std::move (t);
          }
     </pre>
     <p>In this example, copy elision isn't applicable because the type of the
expression being returned and the function return type differ, yet G++
treats the return value as if it were designated by an rvalue.

copy.  This can happen when the range declaration is not a reference, but
probably should be.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct S { char arr[128]; };
          void fn () {
            S arr[5];

     <p>It does not warn when the type being copied is a trivially-copyable type whose
size is less than 64 bytes.

     <p>This warning also warns when a loop variable in a range-based for-loop is
initialized with a value of a different type resulting in a copy.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void fn() {
            int arr[10];
            for (const double &amp;x : arr) { ... }
          }
     </pre>

if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses the anonymous

a type B with no or internal linkage, defining it in multiple

is different in each translation unit.  If A only appears in a single
translation unit, the best way to silence the warning is to give it
internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as well.  The
compiler doesn't give this warning for types defined in the main .C

The warning is enabled at all optimization levels but may yield different
results with optimization than without.

          <dl>
<dt><code>-Wuse-after-free=1</code><dd>At level 1 the warning attempts to diagnose only unconditional uses
of pointers made indeterminate by a deallocation call or a successful
call to <code>realloc</code>, regardless of whether or not the call resulted
in an actual reallocatio of memory.  This includes double-<code>free</code>
calls as well as uses in arithmetic and relational expressions.  Although
undefined, uses of indeterminate pointers in equality (or inequality)
expressions are not diagnosed at this level. 
<br><dt><code>-Wuse-after-free=2</code><dd>At level 2, in addition to unconditional uses, the warning also diagnoses
conditional uses of pointers made indeterminate by a deallocation call. 
As at level 2, uses in equality (or inequality) expressions are not
diagnosed.  For example, the second call to <code>free</code> in the following
function is diagnosed at this level:
          <pre class="smallexample">               struct A { int refcount; void *data; };
               
               void release (struct A *p)
               {
                 int refcount = --p-&gt;refcount;
                 free (p);
                 if (refcount == 0)
                   free (p-&gt;data);   // warning: p may be used after free
               }
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>-Wuse-after-free=3</code><dd>At level 3, the warning also diagnoses uses of indeterminate pointers in
equality expressions.  All uses of indeterminate pointers are undefined
but equality tests sometimes appear after calls to <code>realloc</code> as
an attempt to determine whether the call resulted in relocating the object
to a different address.  They are diagnosed at a separate level to aid
legacy code gradually transition to safe alternatives.  For example,
the equality test in the function below is diagnosed at this level:
          <pre class="smallexample">               void adjust_pointers (int**, int);
               
               void grow (int **p, int n)
               {
                 int **q = (int**)realloc (p, n *= 2);
                 if (q == p)
                   return;
                 adjust_pointers ((int**)q, n);
               }
          </pre>
          <p>To avoid the warning at this level, store offsets into allocated memory
instead of pointers.  This approach obviates needing to adjust the stored
pointers after reallocation.
